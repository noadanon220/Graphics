# AI Logic Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the AI Logic Specification for the SecurityMap Graphics project. The implementation follows the Finite State Machine (FSM) design pattern with intelligent team coordination.

## Architecture

### 1. Commander NPC (The Brain)
**File**: `CommanderNPC.h` / `CommanderNPC.cpp`

**FSM States**:
- **Planning**: Analyzes situation and decides strategy
- **Commanding**: Issues orders to team members
- **Repositioning**: Moves to safer/better command position

**Key Features**:
- Brain tick every 2 seconds (120 frames at 60fps)
- Analyzes team status and enemy positions
- Issues strategic orders without micromanaging
- Repositions for safety when in high-risk areas
- Tracks wounded soldiers, low ammo soldiers, and enemy sightings

**Decision Logic**:
```cpp
if (wounded_soldiers_exist):
    command_medic("Treat soldier X")
if (low_ammo_soldiers_exist):
    command_supplier("Supply soldier Y")
if (enemy_visible AND team_healthy):
    command_warriors("Attack sector Z")
else:
    command_warriors("Defend")
```

### 2. Warriors (The Fighters)
**File**: `WarriorNPC.h` / `WarriorStates.cpp`

**FSM States**:
- **Idle**: Awaiting orders
- **Moving**: Following A* path to ordered position
- **Attacking**: Firing at enemies in range
- **Defending**: Moving to cover, defensive fire
- **Wounded**: Requesting medical aid
- **LowAmmo**: Requesting supply

**Key Features**:
- Execute commander's general orders autonomously
- Find their own routes using A* pathfinding
- Choose weapons intelligently (grenades vs bullets)
- Find firing positions with cover
- Report status back to commander

**Combat Logic**:
- Weapon selection based on target type and cover
- Positioning with cover, avoiding depot placement
- Range checking and line of sight verification
- Autonomous pathfinding with risk weighting

### 3. Medic (The Healer)
**File**: `MedicNPC.h` / `MedicNPC.cpp`

**FSM States**:
- **Idle**: Waiting for orders
- **ToDepot**: A* path to medical depot
- **ToPatient**: A* path to wounded soldier
- **Treating**: Healing soldier to 100% HP

**Key Features**:
- Responds to commander's treatment orders
- Autonomous pathfinding: Depot → Wounded soldier
- Only medic can restore soldier to full health
- Treatment takes 2 seconds to complete

**Process Flow**:
```
Commander: "Treat soldier W1"
→ ToDepot (using A*) 
→ ToPatient (using A* to W1's position)
→ Treating (restore W1 to 100% HP)
→ Idle
```

### 4. Supplier (The Support)
**File**: `SupplierNPC.h` / `SupplierNPC.cpp`

**FSM States**:
- **Idle**: Waiting for orders
- **ToDepot**: A* path to ammo depot
- **ToSoldier**: A* path to soldier needing ammo
- **Supplying**: Restocking soldier's ammo

**Key Features**:
- Responds to commander's supply orders
- Autonomous pathfinding: Ammo depot → Low ammo soldier
- Restocks ammunition and grenades
- Supply takes 1 second to complete

**Process Flow**:
```
Commander: "Supply soldier W2"
→ ToDepot (using A*)
→ ToSoldier (using A* to W2's position)  
→ Supplying (restock W2 to full ammo/grenades)
→ Idle
```

## Team Coordination

### Communication Flow
**File**: `Team.cpp`

**Soldier → Commander Reports**:
- Wounded status (HP < 50%)
- Low ammo status (≤ 15% ammo)
- Enemy sightings
- Mission completion

**Commander → Soldier Orders**:
- General orders: "Attack", "Defend", "Move to area"
- Support orders: "Medic treat W1", "Supplier supply W2"
- No micromanagement - soldiers find their own paths

### Team Management
- **Visibility Map**: Combined visibility from all team members
- **Priority System**: Medical > Supply > Combat
- **Brain Tick**: Commander analyzes situation every 2 seconds
- **Status Reporting**: Automatic status updates to commander

## Algorithms Used

### Pathfinding
- **Standard A***: For medic/supplier routes
- **Risk-aware A***: For warriors (avoids dangerous areas)
- **BFS Search**: For finding safe positions and cover

### Combat & Positioning
- **Cover Finding**: Warriors search for defensive positions
- **Line of Sight**: Bresenham line algorithm for firing
- **Risk Assessment**: Security map integration for safe movement

## Victory Conditions

### Win by destroying ALL enemy depots:
- Each team has: 1 ammo depot + 1 medical depot
- Direct hits destroy depots (80% hit chance bullets, 90% grenades)
- When all enemy depots destroyed → Victory

### Health System:
- **≥50% HP**: Can move and fight
- **25-49% HP**: Can move only (no fighting)
- **<25% HP**: "Disabled" until medic treats

## Implementation Notes

### Commander Brain Tick (every 2 seconds):
1. Check victory conditions
2. Handle wounded soldiers (send medic)
3. Handle low ammo (send supplier)
4. Assess threat level
5. Issue strategic orders (attack/defend)

### Soldier Autonomy:
- Soldiers execute orders independently
- Find their own paths using A*
- Choose weapons autonomously
- Report back to commander

### Team Coordination:
- Shared visibility map for commander
- Priority system: Medical > Supply > Combat
- No friendly fire (check before shooting)

## Key Benefits

1. **Intelligent Behavior**: Commander acts as strategic planner
2. **Tactical Intelligence**: Individual soldiers demonstrate tactical smarts
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add new states or modify behavior
4. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Realistic**: Mimics real military command structure

## Usage

The AI system automatically runs during gameplay:
- Commander analyzes situation every 2 seconds
- Soldiers report status automatically
- Support units respond to commander orders
- Warriors execute combat missions autonomously

No additional setup required - the FSM handles all AI behavior automatically.
